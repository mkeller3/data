Brittany, today is the day. We did it, we are finally getting married. We have now known each other for a little over 4 years after meeting that one night at Joeâ€™s. Since then, so many things have changed, from graduating college and getting real jobs, to losing loved ones. While many things have changed around us there is one thing that has not, and that's us. We have gone through all these changes together, side by side. There is no other person that I would want to be with for the rest of my life. Ever since that first day I met you, I knew something was different about you. At the time, I could not put it into a sentence, but I think that it is pretty clear now. The difference was that you were the one for me.

As we are about to go into the next chapter of our life, I thought to myself. Our journey has only just begun. It has been an amazing four years with you Brittany, and I love you so much. I cannot wait to spend the rest of our lives together.
